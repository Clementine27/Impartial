database: 

1. initialise db instance 

2. define data model for all objects in db 

3. state how the main app should talk to db via model 



define what you want: 
- countries 
- events/year 
- themes 

define schema 

configure how app should find and communicate with database (app.py setup)

ingests external data 

app accesses data via data models (db model/db schema)

app exposes data via API (communicator btw frontend and backend) so frontend can retrieves 





initialise an object that manages data 

then define what are the ground truths that you are interested in (what databases are you holding onto)
